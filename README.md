# Network_Security
Commmit #1
This project consist of implementation of different ciphers.
# classicalCiphers
The package classicalCiphers have implementation of Caesar cipher,hill cipher, playfair and vigenere cipher. The main function is in the Class Test.java from where each of them can be executed.

# des
It is the very well known algorithm Data Encryption Standard.

# fiestel
Implementation of fiestel structure.

# prng
implementation of pseudo random number generators: 1. Blum Blum Shub Generator(BBS) 2. Linear Congruential Generator(LCG)

# rc4
It's the  implementation of the stream cipher Rivest Cipher 4(RC4).

# rng
it contains the implementation of poker test. It checks the randomness of the given random sequence. (The probabilty to fall in all the categories is taken as same but it can be corrected for use.)
